# Snake_Game V1
##### Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a board, eating apples and growing longer with each apple consumed. The goal is to survive as long as possible without running into a wall or the snake's own body. The game features a simple, intuitive gameplay mechanic that is easy to learn but difficult to master.

##### This implementation of the Snake Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is playable directly in a web browser. The game features a responsive canvas element for rendering the game board, and is designed to work on desktop and mobile devices.

##### The player controls the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The snake moves continuously across the board, and the player must navigate the snake to collect apples that randomly appear on the board. Each apple consumed increases the player's score, and causes the snake to grow longer, making it more difficult to avoid running into walls or the snake's own body.

##### The game features a scoring system that keeps track of the player's score, which is displayed on the game board. When the player collides with a wall or the snake's own body, the game ends and the player's final score is displayed on a game over screen. The player has the option to restart the game at any time.

##### Snake Game is a fun and engaging game that tests the player's reflexes and strategic thinking. It is a great example of a simple yet challenging game that can be built using web technologies.
